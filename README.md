# why we use object oriented programming...?

- to not duplicate code
- to follow DRY method
- to reduce bugs

### concepts of OOP

- class --> is the blueprint of common things (class name is called encapsulation)
- constructor --> is the main function which is called inside of the class (built-in function)
- instance --> is the version of the class
- method --> when a function is defined inside of the class then, it is called method
- inheritance --> one constructor function get properties from previous constructor to avoid duplication
- super --> to use property from the previous class we use inheritance but it does not call the previous function immediately. to call them automatically we have to call a method name ===> super()
